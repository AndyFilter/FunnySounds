# Make it Funny
Tired of opening like **20 tabs** of videos like: *One Hour of Silence Broken Only by Random **XYZ** sound effects*? Perhaps running out of RAM, because You are using *Chrome*?
Well, I've got something just for **You**. You can have all Your **funny sounds** and RAM at the **SAME TIME!**. All You need to do is **follow these few simple steps below**!

# How to use

 - Download at: https://github.com/AndyFilter/FunnySounds/releases/latest (Click *assets*, then *FunnySounds.zip*).
 - Just unzip the *FunnySounds.zip* (or don't ðŸ˜«).
 - Run *FunnySounds.exe*
 
 ## Alternatively
 You can just compile the code for Yourself, but if You want to do that You probably already know how to do that

# Requirements
The list is short and simple:

 - .NET 3.1 (You probably already have it)
 - Windows 7+ (No support for rich people and Linux users. Yet)

# About
Still in early access. If You encounter any bugs/glitches, or want to change/add something dm me at discord: **IsPossible#8212**.

I'll add a bit more and make it prettier later... for sure...
